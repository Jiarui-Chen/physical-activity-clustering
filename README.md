## Introduction
This repo is for Kaggle community competition: [Physical Activity Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/physical-activity-clustering). In this competition, we aim to cluster physical activities using data collected from three Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a heart rate monitor. The goal is to accurately classify different activities, which has applications in healthcare, fitness training, and more.
